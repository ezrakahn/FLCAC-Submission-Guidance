#### What dataset gets a DOI
(This should all be moved to an internal operations document)
TODO: An explaination on what is citable from the LCA Commons perspective and how to guide people to making that determination.  The Ag Data Commons uses metrics that can serve as a guide for LCAC (see section 3.2 on externally published resources) :

https://data.nal.usda.gov/ag-data-commons-doi-guidelines-0

There is variability in what constitutes a citable unit of information in LCA, and what is meant by a "dataset"

Regarding guidance for citable datasets, my current thinking is:

1. The datasets is a citable contribution to the scholarly record
2. There exists a published or accessible report describing the datasets development and it's original intention and application.
