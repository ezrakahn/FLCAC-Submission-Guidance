They may not have been formally\r\nreviewed for quality assurance.\r\n\r\nINDUSTRY DATA PRODUCTS are largely published through the USLCI\r\nRepository, which is managed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory\r\n(NREL) and hosted by the NAL.\r\n\r\n# Introduction\r\n\r\nThis handbook is divided into four major sections.\r\n\r\n  - Section 1: Publishing data in the FLCAC\r\n\r\n  - Section 2: How do I publish my data in the FLCAC?\r\n\r\n  - Section 3: Frequently Asked Questions\r\n\r\n  - Section 4: Resources\r\n\r\nSection 1 helps provides a summary of the benefits of publishing in the\r\nFederal LCA Commons (FLCAC), an overview of the existing FLCAC\r\nrepositories and repository groups, and the main dataset standards and\r\nformatting requirements. Section 2 contains detailed guidance for\r\npublishing data in the FLCAC Database in terms of onboarding,\r\nformatting, review, publication, and preservation of data. This section\r\nincludes information on the agreed upon data conventions (e.g.,\r\nnomenclature, formats, metadata, documentation) as well as curation and\r\npublishing instructions. Section 3 provides answers to frequently asked\r\nquestions. Section 4 contains links to templates, tools, and other files\r\nthat support the data submission process. This section also includes\r\nlicensing agreements and the Creative Commons Legal Code.\r\n\r\n# Section 1: Publishing data in the FLCAC\r\n\r\nThis section provides an overview of existing FLCAC repositories and\r\nrepository groups and their contents, a brief guide on how to choose\r\nwhether to publish in an existing or create a new group, and general\r\nrequirements for publishing data in the FLCAC Database. This section is\r\nintended to help interested federal agencies understand the benefits of\r\npublishing their data in the FLCAC Database and set reasonable\r\nexpectations for the publication documentation and standards.\r\n\r\n## **Benefits**\r\n\r\nLCA serves as a benchmarking and comparison tool for sustainable product\r\nand process development. As public and private actors increasingly\r\nutilize LCI data for decision-making and communications along the value\r\nchain, LCI data availability, reliability, and geographic specificity\r\nbecome increasingly important. The FLCAC Database offers federal data\r\ndevelopers with the opportunity to share complete, representative, and\r\nwell-documented LCI data with to a collection of repositories (i.e.,\r\n“groups”) that are also available to the public. The FLCAC resource\r\nallows users with influence across the value chain access to transparent\r\nand representative LCI data alongside guidance for its intended use. The\r\ngoals of the FLCAC Database are to maintain data quality and\r\ntransparency, support the use of LCA, maintain compatibility with other\r\nLCI databases, provide exceptional data accessibility, be fully and\r\nsustainably supported, and support US industry competitiveness.\r\n\r\nTo date, the US FLCAC is the result of coordinated work by the US\r\nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency\r\n(EPA), the National Energy Technology Library (NETL), the National\r\nRenewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the Argonne National Laboratory\r\n(ANL), the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the Federal Highway\r\nAdministration (FHWA), the US Forest Service (USFS), the Federal\r\nAviation Administration (FAA), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the\r\nNational Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST). This\r\ncoordinated work is hereafter referred to as \"the Federal LCA Commons or\r\nFLCAC.\" The FLCAC provides improved and coordinated access to Federal\r\nLCA data. With this collaboration, the agencies have developed a more\r\nstreamlined process for FLCAC data documentation, curation, and\r\npublication aimed at:\r\n\r\n  - <span class=\"underline\">Expanding the FLCAC & Contribute Partner\r\n    Base by</span>:\r\n    \r\n    1.  Establishing the value of the FLCAC\r\n    \r\n    2.  Developing new data providers\r\n    \r\n    3.  Developing a consultive group of users\r\n\r\n  - <span class=\"underline\">Technology Coordination, Integration,\r\n    Interoperability, & Capacity Sharing by</span>:\r\n    \r\n    4.  Developing tools for interacting with data\r\n    \r\n    5.  Developing tools to connect the FLCAC with users\r\n    \r\n    6.  Linking open data services\r\n\r\n  - <span class=\"underline\">Data Coverage, Format, Quality, &\r\n    Interoperability by</span>:\r\n    \r\n    7.  Establishing and maintaining FLCAC data standards\r\n    \r\n    8.  Developing and maintaining a FLCAC governance structure\r\n    \r\n    9.  Adding capability to openLCA\r\n\r\nThe goal of the FLCAC is to leverage individual federal agency mission\r\nactivities to advance LCA data, research and information systems;\r\nimprove modelling methods consistency; and enhance public access to\r\nFederal LCI data. In the near-term, FLCAC will coordinate data\r\ndocumentation, nomenclature, and exchange conventions. In the long-term,\r\nFLCAC will coordinate modelling conventions toward background data sets\r\nfor the US (e.g., for US electricity). FLCAC is positioned to collect,\r\ncompile, and provide public access to data and information that adds\r\nvalue to life cycle assessors in an effective manner via a single-access\r\npoint. The harmonization of documentation standards and digital data\r\npreservation and access will increase reviewability and reduce not only\r\ndata acquisition costs but also computer- and human-based\r\nmisinterpretation errors, and thus, data misuse.\r\n\r\n## **Groups & Repositories**\r\n\r\nIf your main publication goals are aligned with an existing repository\r\nand/or repository group, you may consider submitting your data to an\r\nexisting repository. For example, if your agency has an existing\r\nrepository group, you may want to publish the datasets to a repository\r\nin this group or within a new repository under this group. If your\r\nagency does not have an existing repository and/or repository group, you\r\nmay create one for the desired datasets.\r\n\r\n#### Conventions for Repository Names\r\n\r\n#### Repositories on the LCA Commons have a Group / Repository organizational structure. Repositories are subsets belonging to a Group and inherit all of the Group’s properties and settings. See ‘Adding a Repository’ in the Publication Workflow\r\n\r\n#### Conventions for Repository Metadata\r\n\r\nHere we need to develop and communicate clear distinctions between\r\n“Federal LCA data” and “Data publicly available through government\r\nfunded resources”\r\n\r\n## \r\n\r\n## **Expectations**\r\n\r\nThe FLCAC provides individual gate-to-gate, cradle-to-gate and\r\ncradle-to-grave accounting of the energy and material flows into and out\r\nof the environment that are associated with producing a material,\r\ncomponent, or assembly in the US. These data are intended to cover\r\ncommonly used materials, products, and processes in the US with\r\nup-to-date, critically reviewed LCI data.\r\n\r\n\\[AUGMENT WITH COLLECTION POLICY TIGER TEAM WORK\\]\r\n\r\n## **Placing Your Data in the Public Domain**\r\n\r\nTo support increased access to and sharing of scholarly resources, as\r\nwell as to promote novel and innovative uses of LCA data, FLCAC requires\r\nthat all submitted datasets be placed in the public domain under the\r\nterms of the Creative Commons Legal Code (CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)).\r\nBy placing your datasets in the public domain, according to the CC0 1.0\r\nlicense, you are removing “all of \\[your\\] rights to the work worldwide\r\nunder copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to\r\nthe extent allowed by law.” Please review the legal code of the CC0 1.0\r\nUniversal license before submitting your datasets, as well as the Data\r\nUse Disclaimer Agreement (“Agreement”).\r\n\r\nData providers provide access and use restrictions appropriate to the\r\nuse of their data when publishing in the FLCAC. If your agency has their\r\nown data access use restrictions policy, it should be included in\r\nappropriate section of the published datasets. If your agency does not\r\nhave a specific policy, the FLCAC default may be used (see: Data\r\nProvider’s Content License Agreement (“Agreement”)).\r\n\r\n### **Dataset Citations**\r\n\r\nEach dataset should include a recommended citation to which data users\r\nmay refer. All data published in the FLCAC should be cited using the\r\nfollowing format to acknowledge and credit the work of data creators and\r\nthe FLCAC as the source. For example, \"Data Generator (2019). FLCAC,\r\nRepository, Repository Group Name. Accessed April 15,\r\n2019<span class=\"underline\">: https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration/search/group/repository</span>.\r\n\r\nDOI’s are to be provided \\[through USDA NAL or by each individual\r\nagency\\].\r\n\r\n### **Data Formatting**\r\n\r\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) specifies data\r\ndocumentation formats for LCA in ISO/TS 14048:2002.\r\n\r\n![](./media/image2.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 1. Elements of ISO 14048 LCI & openLCA Process Documentation**\r\n\r\nTo facilitate compliance with this standard and provide a central access\r\nportal, the FLCAC is structured upon the openLCA,\\[1\\] open source LCA\r\nsoftware schema. This schema includes the elements designated in General\r\nData Requirements. To minimize data formatting efforts and ensure all\r\nmetadata elements persist throughout submission, unit process and\r\nproduct system datasets submitted to the LCA Commons should be edited in\r\nthe openLCA desktop modelling application. The openLCA software can be\r\ndownloaded free of charge at\r\n[openLCA.org.](https://sourceforge.net/projects/openlca/) At the\r\nbeginning of the data submission process, you must check with FLCAC\r\nPlatform Administrator to ensure that your openLCA versioning is\r\ncompatible with the FLCAC Collaboration Server. Dataset editing guidance\r\nis provided in the Formatting and Guidance on Data Compilation in\r\nopenLCA sections of this handbook. Once you compile, format, review, and\r\ncurate your unit processes and/or product systems in openLCA, you may\r\nshare them to the pre-selected repository via the FLCAC Collaboration\r\nServer sync tool.\r\n\r\nPlease note that EcoSpold (v1 and v2) and International Reference Life\r\nCycle Data (ILCD) submissions generated by SimaPro, GaBi, ecoEditor, the\r\nILCD editor, or any other editor may not support the required metadata\r\nfields. If you have data sets in these formats, you must first import\r\nand edit these datasets in openLCA. The compiled and formatted data sets\r\nmay then be synced using the aforementioned Collaboration Server tool.\r\nInspecting your data in openLCA prior to submission is an opportunity to\r\npreview how your data will appear in the LCA Commons. Alternatively, if\r\nyour work is in spreadsheets, you can use the openLCA spreadsheet format\r\nto import your data into the openLCA desktop application and then edit\r\nin openLCA.\r\n\r\nThrough the openLCA desktop application, modelers can also access the\r\nwork of others either through shared repositories or through the FLCAC\r\nsearch application. Because the FLCAC Collaboration Server is built upon\r\nthe openLCA data model, agency repositories are comprised of openLCA\r\nJSON formatted files, which will be indexed by the search application.\r\nData sets will be maintained locally as openLCA JSON files and in the\r\nagency repository(ies) by the FLCAC Platform Administrator as openLCA\r\nJSON files. The FLCAC Platform Administrator will make data products\r\navailable for download in JSON-LD and ILCD formats. The FLCAC Platform\r\nAdministrator will provide access to agency repositories and maintain\r\nthe single public facing search application, which will index each\r\npublic repository/repository group and help users browse and search data\r\nsets. The FLCAC Platform Administrator will support agency data product\r\nproviders by publishing repositories and repository groups as directed.\r\n\r\nDetailed guidance on the data submission process is covered in Section\r\n2: How do I publish my data in the FLCAC?\r\n\r\n## **General Data Requirements**\r\n\r\nThe FLCAC can accommodate data types included by the openLCA data model:\r\n\r\n  - Product System Models\r\n\r\n  - Unit Process Models\r\n\r\n  - Life Cycle Impact Methods\r\n\r\n  - Elementary Flows\r\n\r\n  - Data quality methods\r\n\r\n  - Flow Properties\r\n\r\n  - Unit groups\r\n\r\n  - Currencies\r\n\r\n  - Actors\r\n\r\n  - Sources\r\n\r\n  - Locations\r\n\r\nThe FLCAC has a central Platform Administrator that will assign server\r\nuser credentials and manage the server platform. The onus of curating\r\nand publishing data will fall to individual FLCAC member agencies. As\r\nthe FLCAC mega-repository grows, key considerations in LCI database\r\nmanagement are using proactive techniques that prevent technical debt\r\nand to promote consistency, quality, and efficiency of the LCI data\r\ntherein. Guidance for adhering to these criteria are offered in this\r\ndocument to the extent possible for the general use case. Individual\r\nagencies will have specific use cases requiring additional database\r\nmanagement and should designate a FLCAC database administrator\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nPublishing in the FLCAC does not include integrating data sets into\r\ninternally consistent linked data products. The FLCAC Platform\r\nAdministrator does not currently have the capacity to integrate agency\r\ndata sets prior to publication. Any data set integration must occur\r\nlocally, at the agency prior to committing data sets to the FLCAC\r\nCollaboration Servers or by the end-user. Therefore, if an agency\r\ncommits two separate Product System Models (PSMs) to two separate\r\nrepositories and the models use the same electricity model upstream, two\r\ncopies of the electricity model will reside in the FLCAC, rather than a\r\nsingle electricity data set referenced by multiple processes. The FLCAC\r\nis a collection of repositories, rather than an integrated data product.\r\nThis approach will help FLCAC users find and access data sets, but the\r\nonus of integration will fall to the user.\r\n\r\n### Data Reliability and Reproducibility\r\n\r\nFlow data within the unit process(es) must be based on measurements\r\nusing a specified and standardized measurement method OR estimated using\r\nmethods and data described in specified archival or other publicly\r\navailable sources. Furthermore, data should represent a novel\r\ncontribution (i.e., unique process, unique market, update, and dataset\r\ndoes not duplicate existing data) to the LCA community and be\r\nnon-proprietary. If the data are an update to a previously published\r\ndataset, a note will be added to the metadata of the unit process\r\ndataset (i.e., see: Table 4. Administrative Information Field\r\nConventions ‘Intended Application’ field of the ‘Administrative\r\nInformation’ tab). Unit processes that represent proxy upstream\r\nprocesses from external databases should not be submitted (e.g.,\r\necoinvent® process datasets).\r\n\r\n### Data Aggregation, Completeness, & Allocation\r\n\r\nMany of the data sets committed to the FLCAC will be the aggregated\r\nresults of dynamic process models. It is preferred that these data sets\r\nare structured as PSMs, which provides context and relationships among\r\nunit processes. However, these PSMs may be published as aggregated unit\r\nprocesses, if necessary. It is understood that a certain level of\r\naggregation may be required to protect confidential data. In these\r\ncases, it is requested to aggregate only as much as needed to protect\r\nthe data. Any aggregated or product system datasets must include\r\ndocumentation stating the type of and motivation for the aggregation\r\n(e.g., horizontal averaging, vertical aggregation; proprietary,\r\nease-of-use).\\[2\\] Unit processes may be submitted as single\r\ngate-to-gate processes, or related processes grouped as product or\r\nintermediate product systems. If multiple unit processes for a product\r\nsystem are submitted, the linking between them should be explicit.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, agencies may commit “empty” PSMs, which provide the\r\nrelationships and context of individual unit processes and perhaps\r\nreferences to background data sets, but do not include values. The use\r\ncase for empty PSMs is to distribute industry standard models, which can\r\nbe used to develop environmental product declarations (EPDs).\r\n\r\nThough both unit process and system-level datasets may be submitted, the\r\nFLCAC is striving for all Federal background data to be provided at a\r\nunit process level. Please keep this in mind as you submit datasets for\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nMulti-functional unit processes should include all co-products and may\r\nalso include allocation factors or displaced products (according to the\r\ndiscretion of the submitter). The allocation approach should be\r\njustified and clearly described.\r\n\r\nAgencies may also publish partial data sets (e.g. life cycle greenhouse\r\ngas or water assessments) or partially terminated data sets (foreground\r\ndata sets), provided they are named, categorized, and documented\r\naccording to the FLCAC conventions.\r\n\r\nA technosphere exchange that does not have a providing process included\r\nin the same repository should be documented.\r\n\r\nProcesses from other databases should not be submitted as datasets.\r\n\r\n### Nomenclature\r\n\r\nDetailed guidance on process and flow nomenclature is\r\nprovided in Table 1. General Information Field Conventions. Elementary Flow nomenclature specific guidance can be found in Appendix: D FEDEFL Nomenclature Rules, while guidance on Technosphere Flow and Process nomenclature can be found in Appendix:E ILCD Nomenclature Rules.\r\n\r\n#### Categorization\r\n\r\nDatasets from different databases with disparate categorization schemes\r\ncan prevent connectivity, cause duplications and/or confusion among\r\nusers, and result in a bulky database. Flows are categorized as either elementary or technosphere flows.\r\n\r\nTherefore, FLCAC has adopted the\r\nEPA Flow List for elementary flow classification. Elementary flows are further classified into eight classes as described in Appendix D: Rule 4 The classification of elementary flows allows for a more systematic approach to the creation of the FEDEFL.\r\n \r\nTechnosphere flows and intermediate processes are further classified using the North American\r\nIndustry Classification System (NAICS) 2 digit/4 digit classification\r\nscheme for categorizing intermediate processes and technosphere flows\r\n(see:\r\n[<span class=\"underline\">https://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/</span>](https://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/)).\r\nPlease ensure that your datasets are submitted using this format and\r\nreflect the latest NAICS updates, which occur roughly every three to\r\nfour years.\r\n\r\nAdditional guidance for using the EPA Elementary Flow list can be found on the FEDEFL [<span class=\"underline\">github repository wiki page](https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List/wiki) or the [<span class=\"underline\">FEDEFL guidance document](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=341199). Additional guidance on the ILCD nomenclature for technosphere and process nomenclature can be located in the [<span class=\"underline\">ILCD Handbook</span>](http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/uploads/MANPROJ-PR-ILCD-Handbook-Nomenclature-and-other-conventions-first-edition-ISBN-fin-v1.0-E.pdf)\r\n### Data Quality Scheme\r\n\r\nWithin openLCA, the only data quality scheme available by default is\r\nthat of ecoinvent®. Publishing agencies may have developed their own\r\nscheme and still, some may not use a scheme at all. The FLCAC does not\r\nrequire a specific scheme be utilized; however, there is guidance in\r\nthis document on how to utilize the EPA Data Quality Pedigree Matrix if\r\nit is elected. The USLCI uses the EPA Data Quality Pedigree Matrix\r\n(downloaded and imported into openLCA from the GreenDelta downloads\r\npage).\r\n\r\n### Global Parameters\r\n\r\nPer the developers of openLCA, project- and even “global”-level\r\nparameters defined in the openLCA desktop application (i.e.,\r\nagency-user-defined strings with character restrictions) are not\r\ncompatible between FLCAC repositories. This means that the FLCAC has no\r\ndefined list of global-level parameters and no parameterization will\r\noccur between server repositories and/or repository groups. However,\r\nparameters defined as “global” in the openLCA desktop application are\r\nreflected when committed to a single repository on the FLCAC server. To\r\nensure data compatibility across FLCAC repositories and repository\r\ngroups, FLCAC has elected to limit the number of ‘global parameters’\r\nallowable for use in the FLCAC repository. Please check the FLCAC\r\nPlatform Administrator if your datasets require the use of a\r\nrepository-level, global parameter.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nAs datasets in a repository are created, modified, and/or removed, a\r\nrecord or change log of these occurrences shall be made. Each agency\r\nshall maintain change logs individually such that a centralized FLCAC\r\nchange log may be made available by the FLCAC Platform Administrator at\r\n\\[an interval to be defined\\]. Individual agency repository\r\nadministrators should track changes made to the repository alongside the\r\ncommit history.Any updates to these guidelines shall be noted along with\r\nthe centralized FLCAC change log.\r\n\r\n# Section 2: How do I publish my data in the FLCAC?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this section is to help you, the Data Provider,\r\nunderstand the process for publishing LCI data in the [FLCAC\r\nDatabase](https://uslci.lcacommons.gov/uslci/search).\r\n\r\nThis section is divided into the following subsections.\r\n\r\n1.  Coordinating work in the FLCAC Collaboration Server\r\n\r\n2.  Overview of the \\`Digital Curation Process’\r\n\r\n3.  The openLCA field conventions and metadata guidance\r\n\r\n## **Coordinating Working in the FLCAC Collaboration Server**\r\n\r\nThe onus of curating and publishing data will fall to individual FLCAC\r\nmember agencies. As the FLCAC mega-repository grows, key considerations\r\nin LCI database management are using proactive techniques that prevent\r\ntechnical debt and to promote consistency, quality, and efficiency of\r\nthe LCI data therein. Guidance for adhering to these criteria are\r\noffered in this document to the extent possible for the general use\r\ncase. Individual agencies will have specific use cases requiring\r\nadditional database management and should designate a FLCAC database\r\nadministrator accordingly.\r\n\r\nEstablishing a repository on the FLCAC Collaboration Server requires an\r\nongoing institutional partnership with the FLCAC, in which your agency\r\nactively curates, manages, and updates its repository(ies) according to\r\nFLCAC’s data conventions, while the FLCAC Platform Administrator provide\r\nsystem administration, and persistent access to the repository.\r\n\r\nThe FLCAC Platform Administrator (NAL) will host one or multiple\r\nrepository group(s) for each partner agency as necessary. Partner\r\nagencies will maintain and archive data sets within the group\r\nrepository(ies) locally and maintain and version data hosted at the NAL.\r\nPartner agencies must maintain data products in the version of openLCA\r\ndesktop application, which is current with the version deployed for the\r\nFLCAC Collaboration Server.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this section is to guide you through the publication\r\nprocess. These guidelines are compiled to assist in the curation of data\r\nsets to ensure that agency data products are compliant with agreed upon\r\nconventions related to naming, categorization, nomenclature, and\r\nstructure within the openLCA data model. These instructions can help you\r\nin, completing dataset metadata fields and using the openLCA\r\nCollaboration Server platform. The objective of these guidelines is to\r\nassure data set consistency for indexing, display, and search.\r\n\r\nYour role in the publication process is to transform your raw LCI data\r\ninto a product that is ready for publication in the FLCAC Database and\r\nto submit the data to the Collaboration Server using the openLCA desktop\r\napplication. ‘Transform’ means to put your data into the FLCAC\r\nDatabase's [data\r\nformat](https://github.com/uslci-admin/private-uslci-content/blob/dev/docs/submission_handbook/02-how-to-publish-in-the-uslci.md#data-publication-platform) and\r\npair your data with robust metadata so that your data users understand\r\nhow to properly interpret and apply your data.The documentation,\r\nmetadata guidance, and resources in this Data Submission Guide will be\r\nessential resources in that process.\r\n\r\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) specifies a\r\nframework for archival concepts necessary for long-term digital\r\ninformation preservation and access in ISO 14721:2012. This framework\r\ndesignates the importance of provenance information such as the history\r\nof content information, custody, and change history.\r\n\r\n![](./media/image3.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 2. Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Preservation\r\nDescription Information**\r\n\r\nTo facilitate compliance with these standards, FLCAC users are\r\nencouraged to use the openLCA Collaboration Server including the\r\neditorial features as their principal project management and\r\ncommunication tool. In this way, member teams may communicate and\r\ncoordinate member data curation and maintenance of their FLCAC\r\nrepository(ies) on the server. The editorial features assist in the\r\nstorage, handling, and migration of LCI data during the curation and\r\npublication process. This platform contains robust features for version\r\ncontrol, issues management, and team communication. Moreover, it makes\r\nit easy for the Data Provider to keep a local version of the data\r\ncuration process and end product once the project is complete. Early in\r\nthe publication process, the FLCAC Platform Administrator will work with\r\nyou to get you set up with a username and one or more private data\r\nrepositories on the platform.\r\n\r\n![](./media/image4.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 3. Team coordination schematic for database management on FLCAC\r\nCollaboration Server**\r\n\r\nUsing this application, LCA data may be edited within a local openLCA\r\ndatabase and then directly committed to the collaboration server. The\r\nnew server-software synergy will allow authorized users to collaborate\r\non data provision and editing from any workstation. Public users can\r\naccess the data and make comments on the repository content\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the Formatting section, FLCAC uses openLCA as its\r\nplatform for receiving, reviewing, and publishing LCI data. The\r\n[openLCA](http://www.openlca.org/) software is a free, open source LCA\r\ndesktop application in which end-users can import data from many public\r\nand commercial LCA software applications including GaBi and SimaPro. The\r\nopenLCA desktop application is also the platform from which your data\r\nmay be synced to the FLCAC Collaboration Server online\r\n\r\nThe homepage for the FLCAC is\r\n[<span class=\"underline\">www.lcacommons.gov</span>](http://www.lcacommons.gov).\r\nAgency members will have capability to access FLCAC data sets via this\r\nplatform according to assigned user roles. Repositories, by default, are\r\nset as private but the Owner of a repository can set the status to\r\npublic (see: Publication and designate users to have access with\r\nspecific roles or they may be set as public, in which case, all agency\r\nmembers have access. Public end-users will also be able to access all\r\npublished FLCAC data sets, which reside on the FLCAC Collaboration\r\nServer, through the content management application (i.e., all group\r\nrepositories set to ‘public’ status).\r\n\r\n## **Overview of the Digital Curation Process**\r\n\r\nFLCAC uses a Digital Curation Process for receiving, reviewing,\r\npublishing, and preserving data and metadata submitted to the FLCAC\r\nDatabase. The process is divided into five phases:\r\n\r\n1.  Onboarding\r\n\r\n2.  Formatting\r\n\r\n3.  Review & Curation\r\n\r\n4.  Publication\r\n\r\n5.  Preservation\r\n\r\nEach of the five phases is discussed in detail below but a quick\r\noverview of the entire procedure for submitting data to the FLCAC is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nOnce the agency has developed data for the FLCAC:\r\n\r\n  - **Install Software**: If not already in use, download the openLCA\r\n    software for free from\r\n    [<span class=\"underline\">http://www.openlca.org/download/</span>](http://www.openlca.org/download/)\r\n    and install it on your desktop\r\n\r\n  - **Establish Data Quality System**: If using a data quality system,\r\n    install or establish a consistent system for your team; e.g., use\r\n    default ecoinvent® system, agency-specific system, or download the\r\n    [US EPA’s data quality system](http://www.openlca.org/download/) and\r\n    import it into openLCA\r\n\r\n  - **Format Data**: use these Submission Guidelines to format the\r\n    preliminary LCI data in openLCA, including data quality if elected\r\n    \r\n  - **Map Elementary Flows to FEDEFL**: Use the instructions found on the [FEDEFL wiki](https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List/wiki) to map the\r\n    openLCA database to existing FEDEFL flows   \r\n\r\n  - **Obtain FLCAC Server Account**: If not yet an existing account\r\n    user, the FLCAC Platform Administrator will set up the FLCAC\r\n    Collaboration Server account for the submitting agency\r\n\r\n  - **Commit to Private Repository**: Commit your datasets from an\r\n    openLCA database to a private repository on your selected group on\r\n    the Collaboration Server\r\n\r\n  - **Curate Datasets on Server**: agency team may use the Collaboration\r\n    Server editorial features to communicate edits and finalize the\r\n    curation of the private version of the datasets on the FLCAC\r\n    platform\r\n\r\n  - **Publish Datasets on Server**: Once the agency (agency team) has\r\n    approved the indexing of the datasets in the private version, the\r\n    final version is approved and migrated to the agency’s public\r\n    repository group\r\n\r\n  - **Maintain Datasets on Server**: The agency maintains the local\r\n    openLCA desktop version of the datasets for preservation\r\n    individually and coordinates as a team to commit their edits to the\r\n    server private working repository; here, best practices for all in\r\n    the agency team are to:\r\n    \r\n      - **Fetch Changes from Server**: Connect to the Collaboration\r\n        Server to fetch the latest changes to the private server working\r\n        repository to your desktop application\r\n    \r\n      - **Make Updates Locally**: Edit to make changes, augment, update\r\n        or add datasets in the local desktop version\r\n    \r\n      - **Commit Updates** **to Server**: Commit changes to the private\r\n        agency working repository for internal agency review (using the\r\n        editorial features)\r\n    \r\n      - **Publish Updates**: when approved, team changes can be migrated\r\n        to the public agency repository group for publication by the\r\n        agency repository administrator\r\n\r\n![](./media/image5.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 4. General workflow schematic between agency team members on\r\nthe FLCAC server**\r\n\r\nThe harmonization of documentation standards as well as digital data\r\npreservation and access will increase the collaboration potential and\r\nreviewability of the LCA data exchange process. Increasing harmonized\r\ncollaboration among agencies and stakeholders in compiling and\r\nmaintaining LCA data will significantly reduce not only data acquisition\r\ncosts but also computer- and human-based misinterpretation errors, and\r\nthus, data misuse.\r\n\r\nThe FLCAC uses JSON-LD and ILCD file formats,\\[3\\] formats that retain\r\ndurability (i.e., stored metadata travel well with the moved files).\r\nBecause the FLCAC Collaboration Server is built upon the openLCA data\r\nmodel, which supports this file type, FLCAC repositories are comprised\r\nof openLCA JSON and ILCD formatted files, which will be indexed by the\r\nsearch application. Data sets will be maintained locally as openLCA JSON\r\nor ILCD files and in the agency repository(ies) by the FLCAC Platform\r\nAdministrator as openLCA JSON and ILCD files. The FLCAC Platform\r\nAdministrator will make data products available for download in JSON-LD\r\nand ILCD formats. The FLCAC Platform Administrator will provide access\r\nto agency repositories and maintain the single public facing search\r\napplication, which will index each public repository/repository group\r\nand help users browse and search data sets. The FLCAC Platform\r\nAdministrator will support agency data product providers by publishing\r\nrepositories and repository groups as directed.\r\n\r\n## **Onboarding**\r\n\r\nThe objective of the Onboarding phase is to obtain the tools needed to\r\nuse the FLCAC Collaboration Server.\r\n\r\nThe Onboarding phase is composed of the following elements:\r\n\r\n1.  **Download Software**: Download and install the openLCA desktop\r\n    application (if not an existing user)\r\n\r\n2.  **Data Quality**: (where appropriate) convert data quality to EPA\r\n    Data Quality Pedigree Matrix system compatible with the openLCA\r\n    software\r\n\r\n3.  **Credentials**: Acquire a FLCAC Collaboration Server username and\r\n    password. The FLCAC Platform Administrator will assign your team\r\n    with the required credentials\r\n\r\n4.  **Guidelines**: Download this & GreenDelta’s LCA Collaboration\r\n    Server Manual to have on hand\r\n\r\n5.  **Server:** Bookmark the FLCAC portal landing page\r\n\r\nTo facilitate compliance with this standard and provide a central access\r\nportal, the FLCAC is structured upon the openLCA,\\[4\\] open source LCA\r\nsoftware schema. The openLCA software can be downloaded free of charge\r\nat from\r\n<span class=\"underline\"><http://www.openlca.org/download/>.</span> At\r\nthe beginning of the data submission process, you must check with FLCAC\r\nPlatform Administrator to ensure that your openLCA versioning is\r\ncompatible with the FLCAC Collaboration Server.\r\n\r\nIf your team will be using a data quality system, ensure that system is\r\ncompatible with the openLCA software and distributed among the team.\r\nWithin openLCA, the only data quality scheme available by default is\r\nthat of ecoinvent®. The USLCI uses the EPA Data Quality Pedigree Matrix\r\n(downloaded and imported into openLCA from GreenDelta’s web page). The\r\nFLCAC does not require a specific scheme be utilized; however, Appendix\r\nG: Using the EPA Data Quality Pedigree Matrix in openLCA provides\r\ninstructions for utilizing the EPA Data Quality Pedigree Matrix.\r\n\r\n## **Formatting**\r\n\r\nThe Formatting phase is concerned with entering your datasets into the\r\nopenLCA software. To minimize data formatting efforts and ensure all\r\nmetadata elements persist throughout submission, unit process and\r\nproduct system datasets submitted to the LCA Commons should be edited\r\nusing this modelling application.\r\n\r\nName all original data sets that you submit to FLCAC according to the\r\nILCD naming convention (see Guidance on Data Compilation in openLCA).\r\nThe name should reflect the process or activity as follows: base name;\r\ntreatment, routes, standards; production type, location type;\r\nquantitative flow properties. If you have modified or customized a unit\r\nprocess from a commercial database, FLCAC requests that you submit the\r\nprocess named exactly as it is in the original process with an\r\nindication (i.e., in the comment field) that it is a modified version of\r\nthe original. For example, the comment for the modified ecoinvent®\r\nprocess “carbon dioxide liquid, at plant/RER U” might read: ‘adapted to\r\nreflect US average electricity grid.’\r\n\r\nDetailed guidance on process and technosphere flow nomenclature is provided in Table\r\n1. General Information Field Conventions and Appendix E:ILCD\r\nNomenclature Rules. A technosphere flow that is not being submitted as a\r\ndataset and is not already in the FLCAC should be categorized in the\r\nTechnosphere Flows\\\\‘CUTOFF’ folder or a reasonable proxy from the FLCAC\r\nidentified with a note in the ‘Input Flow, Description’ field regarding\r\nthe flow origin (database and flow name). Processes from other databases\r\nshould not be submitted as datasets.\r\n\r\n### Elementary Flow Names\r\n\r\nElementary flows are data components of LCA data that describe common\r\nphysical items that move from the technosphere into nature or vice\r\nversa. They are used in exchanges in life cycle inventory (LCI) data to\r\nrepresent these movements into and out of processes, and they are used\r\nin Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods to match inventory data\r\nwith impact characterization factors. Hence, they serve a critical role\r\nin LCA modeling and are essential in achieving LCA data\r\ninteroperability.\r\n\r\nThe US EPA has developed a master elementary Flow List ([the FEDEFL](https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List)), which is\r\navailable in CSV and openLCA schema JSON-LD formats, and provides resources to help with mappings. The current release version is available via the\r\nFLCAC portal. The ([the FEDEFL wiki](https://github.com/USEPA/Federal-LCA-Commons-Elementary-Flow-List/wiki))\r\nprovides guidance on converting an established Flow List in a standard openLCA format to FEDEFL\r\nflows. Please see the US EPA report, [The Federal LCA Commons Elementary Flow List: Background, Approach, Description and Recommendations for Use](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?dirEntryId=347251&Lab=NRMRL&simpleSearch=0&showCriteria=2&searchAll=elementary+flows&TIMSType=Published+Report&dateBeginPublishedPresented=07%2F31%2F2019) for more information regarding the Flow List requirements and nomenclature.\r\n\r\nElementary flow names must correspond directly to the impact method used\r\nin the LCIA. This protocol assures users that your dataset can connect\r\nyour elementary flows to the associated LCIA method. Document LCIA\r\nmethods used in the ‘Intended Application’ field of the Administrative\r\nInformation tab in openLCA. If data being submitted have NOT been used\r\nin an LCIA, please use flows from the openLCA reference list. If you\r\nused SimaPro or GaBi modeling software and an impact method that is also\r\nprovided for in the openLCA suite of LCIA methods, please run your\r\ninventory and impact results in openLCA and compare them to those\r\nobtained in SimaPro or GaBi to confirm that openLCA is reading flows\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\n### Intermediate Flow Names\r\n\r\nIntermediate flows are are either products or processes from the\r\ntechnosphere (i.e., not elementary flows).\r\n\r\n1.  > ***Intermediate product flows*** are technosphere flows that are a\r\n    > product of one or more processes and have flowable names and flow\r\n    > properties. Technosphere or product flows are the result of a\r\n    > process (or processes) and flow as exchanges between processes\r\n    > (unlike elementary flows that flow as exchanges to and from\r\n    > environmental compartments). All intermediate product flow names\r\n    > should be decoupled from their associated activity flow names\r\n    > (i.e., process name) for transparency and clarity. That is, a\r\n    > product name should not contain metadata that is specific to the\r\n    > activity context such as the location or year. The intermediate\r\n    > product name should be generic to any activity context so as to\r\n    > avoid unnecessary duplication of product flow names. Likewise,\r\n    > product flow properties such as units, formulas, synonyms,\r\n    > infrastructural flow designation, etc. may be defined in the\r\n    > metadata and should also not be included in the flowable name.\r\n\r\n2.  > An ***intermediate process*** is an activity containing at least\r\n    > one intermediate product flow. Activities are exchanges containing\r\n    > at least one input flow and one output flow (i.e., defining a\r\n    > relationship between flows). The intermediate process flow name\r\n    > should reflect the product or service it represents; the product\r\n    > reference output is given the same name as the process name; the\r\n    > naming conventions are as follows: Base name; treatment, routes,\r\n    > standards; production type, location type; quantitative flow\r\n    > properties. The base name is a general descriptive name of the\r\n    > process using technical language. The technical name should be\r\n    > given as it is used in the respective industry or toward their\r\n    > customers. The standards include qualitative information about the\r\n    > process in technical terms (see Rules 12-17 Appendix D: ILCD\r\n    > Nomenclature Rules or the full [ILCD\r\n    > Handbook](http://eplca.jrc.ec.europa.eu/uploads/MANPROJ-PR-ILCD-Handbook-Nomenclature-and-other-conventions-first-edition-ISBN-fin-v1.0-E.pdf)\r\n    > for a list of potential descriptive terms). The quantitative\r\n    > process properties further specify information on process in\r\n    > technical quantitative term(s).\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, data curation services will not include integrating data\r\nsets into internally consistent linked data products. Any data set\r\nintegration must occur locally, at the agency prior to committing data\r\nsets to the FLCAC Collaboration Servers or by the end-user. To link\r\nprocesses in your datasets, use the exact nomenclature of the\r\nintermediate flow. If the process to be linked only exists in another\r\nagency repository, a duplicate of the process may be submitted or the\r\nexact nomenclature used and the repository noted in the ‘Input Flow,\r\nDescription’ field. Processes from other databases (i.e., already\r\nexisting outside the FLCAC) should not be submitted as datasets.\r\nTherefore, a technosphere flow that is not being submitted as a dataset\r\nand is not already in the FLCAC should be categorized in the\r\nTechnosphere Flows\\\\ ‘CUTOFF’ folder or a reasonable proxy from the\r\nFLCAC identified with a note in the ‘Input Flow, Description’ field\r\nregarding the flow origin (database and flow name).\r\n\r\n### Metadata Guidance\r\n\r\nAs FLCAC interagency coordination increases, the new standard for data\r\nformats and documentation is being advanced. In order to move toward\r\ninteroperability and transparency, FLCAC harmonization of digital data\r\naccess and preservation will increase our collaboration potential and\r\nthe reviewability of the LCA data exchange process. These efforts will\r\nsignificantly reduce not only data acquisition costs but also computer-\r\nand human-based misinterpretation errors, and thus, data misuse.\r\n\r\nAs such, and to be more aligned with international protocols for all\r\nnewly developed data, the current FLCAC repository standardization is to\r\nstrive for 100 percent metadata completion To facilitate each agency’s\r\naccomplishment of this criteria, these guidelines include complete\r\nMetadata Guidance Tables with conventions and examples for every field\r\nin the openLCA JSON-LD format (except ‘Social aspects’). The tables are\r\narranged by the field sections as displayed in the tabs of the openLCA\r\nwindow views.\r\n\r\n![](./media/image6.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 5. openLCA window view – field section tabs**\r\n\r\nThe Metadata Guidance Tables will help you complete the formatting stage\r\nfor your datasets so that you are prepared for the Review phase.\r\n\r\n## **Review**\r\n\r\nOnce your datasets are formatted in the openLCA JSON-LD desktop\r\napplication and all metadata fields are completed, the datasets can be\r\nsynced to the FLCAC Collaboration Server for the Review phase. The first\r\ntime you sync your data to the FLCAC Collaboration Server, you will\r\nfirst need to complete the Onboarding tasks and create a repository\r\n(within a group) on the FLCAC server.\r\n\r\nAn overview of the Review phase is as follows:\r\n\r\n  - **Obtain Server Account**: If not yet an existing user, the FLCAC\r\n    Platform Administrator will set up the FLCAC Collaboration Server\r\n    account for the submitting agency\r\n\r\n  - **Commit to Private Server Repository**: Commit your datasets from\r\n    an openLCA database to a private repository on the Collaboration\r\n    Server\r\n\r\n  - **Curate Data** on Server: agency team may use the Collaboration\r\n    Server editorial features to communicate edits and finalize the\r\n    private version of the datasets on the platform\r\n\r\n  - > ![](./media/image5.png)\r\n\r\n  - **Figure 6.

Repository-connected database in openLCA**\r\n\r\n5)  **Commit:** Now that your openLCA desktop application is connected\r\n    to the server repository, you can commit the data to the server\r\n    repository by right-clicking on the database and selecting\r\n    ***“Repository \\> Commit.”*** You should see the commit window\r\n    appear.\r\n\r\n![](./media/image16.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 15. Commit changes to a repository**\r\n\r\n**Commit, cont.:** You must select the entities you wish to commit and\r\nenter a commit message. Best practices for commit messages include short\r\nphrases indicating the datasets being committed. The commit message will\r\ndisplay next to each dataset committed in the Collaboration Server (see\r\nnext page) and if the message is extensive, it will affect the ease of\r\nnavigation through the data as it displays on the server.\r\n\r\nIf you are committed a large number of datasets for the first time, the\r\ncommit action can take some time (minutes up to an hour for very large\r\ndatasets). However, once the repository is established, updates may be\r\ncommitted in seconds. For reference, the entire USLCI Database takes\r\nabout four minutes to commit to a new repository. You should see\r\nmessages indicating that the application is:\r\n\r\n  - Searching for referenced changes\r\n\r\n  - Checking against libraries\r\n\r\n  - Committing changes\r\n\r\n  - Estimated time: \\# minutes\r\n\r\n  - Indexing datasets\r\n\r\n![](./media/image17.png)\r\n\r\n![](./media/image18.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 16. Progress indicators for database change commits**\r\n\r\n6)  **View Commits:** Once the repository is committed, you should be\r\n    able to navigate to your repository on the Collaboration Server and\r\n    verify the presence of your datasets, when the change was made, and\r\n    the commit message.\r\n\r\n![](./media/image19.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 17. Viewing commits on the FLCAC portal**\r\n\r\n#### <span class=\"smallcaps\">Using the Editorial Features to Curate Data</span>\r\n\r\nOnce the desktop repository has been synced to the Collaboration Server\r\nand is viewable on the FLCAC portal, you can use the editorial features\r\nto curate the initial commit and/or to curate ongoing updates to your\r\nrepository. Each FLCAC member agency should coordinate with their\r\nrespective team(s) to individually manage the data curation process for\r\ntheir respective repositories.\r\n\r\n![](./media/image20.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 18. GreenDelta Collaboration Server Use Case: Editorial\r\nFeatures**\r\n\r\nFirst, repository roles should be assigned to team members. Only\r\nrepository Owners can assign roles. Owners can also create, move, and\r\ndelete repositories, adjust repository settings, and edit repository\r\nmembers. An Editor may manage reviews and comments. A Reviewer can\r\nreview comments and comment on specific dataset fields. A Contributor\r\ncan commit to repositories and a Reader may only view and fetch\r\nrepositories. It is up to each agency repository administrator to\r\ndetermine the best user rights configuration for his/her team. The\r\nfollowing table gives an overview of roles and user rights that may be\r\nassigned in the FLCAC Collaboration Server.\r\n\r\n**Table 1-1. Repository roles and associated user rights**\r\n\r\n| Repository Rights               | Reader | Contributor | Reviewer | Editor | Owner |\r\n| ------------------------------- | ------ | ----------- | -------- | ------ | ----- |\r\n| View & fetch                    | ✔      | ✔           | ✔        | ✔      | ✔     |\r\n| Commit data                     |        | ✔           | ✔        | ✔      | ✔     |\r\n| Comment on specific fields      |        |             | ✔        | ✔      | ✔     |\r\n| Review comments                 |        |             | ✔        | ✔      | ✔     |\r\n| Manage comments                 |        |             |          | ✔      | ✔     |\r\n| Manage review tasks             |        |             |          | ✔      | ✔     |\r\n| Create repositories             |        |             |          |        | ✔     |\r\n| Edit repository members & roles |        |             |          |        | ✔     |\r\n| Adjust settings                 |        |             |          |        | ✔     |\r\n| Move repositories               |        |             |          |        | ✔     |\r\n| Delete repositories             |        |             |          |        | ✔     |\r\n\r\n**Dashboard:** Once roles and user rights have been assigned, toggle the\r\neditorial features (i.e., “review mode”) by using the pencil icon in the\r\nupper-right of the home screen when you login to the FLCAC portal. The\r\nchat icon allows messaging between repository team members and the paper\r\ntray icon opens the task manager.\r\n\r\n![](./media/image21.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 19. FLCAC portal member dashboard features**\r\n\r\n**Task Manager:** Using the platform’s task system requires that at\r\nleast one team user has Reviewer user rights. This system will help the\r\nagency-assigned repository administrator orchestrate the Data Curation\r\ntasks by allowing a repository owner and his/her team members to\r\nidentify, assign, track, and resolve issues that arise during the\r\ncuration process.\r\n\r\nThe editorial features also allow entire data sets and/or specific\r\nfields of a data set to be commented on in the review mode (pencil icon\r\nin upper-right of the user dashboard). Once activated, the review mode\r\ndisplays speech bubbles for each commentable field. The comments can be\r\nreleased immediately as a draft or for review by the moderator. These\r\ncomments will also be displayed in the ‘Comments’ tab in the local\r\nopenLCA user’s desktop application in the synced database. These tools\r\nwill make the curation process more efficient and ensure that all\r\nrelevant correspondence is in a single location.\r\n\r\nThe features allow review tasks to be created such that specific\r\ndatasets may be slated for review and tasks assigned to team members.\r\n\r\n![](./media/image22.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 20. Creating a new review task on the FLCAC portal**\r\n\r\nThe Collaboration Server editorial features task system allows tasks to\r\nbe assigned to specific team members (i.e., as reviewers). A task noted\r\n“in progress” is awaiting release or moderation depending on whether\r\nthe user has Editor or Reviewer role status. A “completed” task has been\r\nreleased and/or reviewed, and a “canceled” task simply indicates no\r\nfurther action is required.\r\n\r\n![](./media/image23.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 21. FLCAC portal editorial features review task dashboard**\r\n\r\nWithin the datasets slated for curation, there are comment bubbles for\r\neach field so that team members can leave notes for any element.\r\nComments can be made in datasets but are not viewable until released.\r\n\r\n![](./media/image24.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 22. Adding comments to datasets**\r\n\r\nReleasing comments allows designated team members to view the comments,\r\neither one-by-one in the individual comment bubbles of the dataset\r\nfields or all-at-once in a list of comments (viewable by toggling\r\n“Comments” on the left-hand side of the dashboard screen).\r\n\r\n![](./media/image25.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 23. Releasing comments for review**\r\n\r\n![](./media/image26.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 24. Tracking review progress in datasets**\r\n\r\nOn the left-hand side of the dashboard screen, team members can see all\r\ncomments in a list view by toggling “Comments.”\r\n\r\n![](./media/image27.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 25. Viewing compiled review comments**\r\n\r\nTeam members can see comments in their respective desktop applications\r\nby fetching changes. Just as on the FLCAC server when signed in, users\r\nmay view comments in the desktop application in two ways: 1) within the\r\ndataset, and 2) as a compiled list.\r\n\r\n![](./media/image28.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 26. Viewing comments in openLCA desktop dataset**\r\n\r\n### ![](./media/image29.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 27. Viewing comments in openLCA desktop as compiled list**\r\n\r\nFetch & Commit Workflow\r\n\r\nFor team members to coordinate maintenance and curation of FLCAC\r\nrepositories, the openLCA desktop application allows changes to be made\r\nto, viewed, and/or retrieved from the remote server. The desktop\r\napplication uses the term “Commit” to refer to the action of committing\r\nlocal changes to the server; whereas, the term “Fetch” is for retrieving\r\nserver versions to the local desktop. Any changes and curation comments\r\nmay also be viewed remotely and/or synced to or from the local server.\r\nServer comments may be reviewed without affecting a local database but\r\nto reflect in a local database those commits made by other team members\r\nto server repositories, users must “fetch” changes and use the “Diff\r\nTool.” The Diff Tool displays the differences between the local version\r\nof a database and that of the associated server repository.\r\n\r\nTo fetch changes from a server repository, right-click on the desktop\r\ndatabase in openLCA and select ***“Repository \\> Fetch.”*** If no\r\nchanges have been committed by other team members, you will see a\r\nmessage “Up to date – No changes fetched.” If updates or changes have\r\nbeen made by team members, you will see a list of changes to be fetched,\r\nwhich provides a summary of changed and/or new elements. Once you select\r\n“OK,” the “Diff Tool” window will display. This tool allows you to\r\nreview changes and either accept the server changes or retain the local\r\ndesktop status of each element. Simply, select “move from right to left”\r\nto accept the changed element from the server and “mark as merged” to\r\nreject the server change and retain the current element of the local\r\nversion. FLCAC recommends fetching changes with a frequency appropriate\r\nfor the activity frequency of the team to maintain transparency and\r\nclarity of tracing changes and avoiding conflicts.\r\n\r\n### Time Requirements\r\n\r\nThe Review phase can involve iterative communications via the Tasks\r\ntracker on your FLCAC repository and often requires the most time in the\r\ndata curation process. It is left to individual agencies to complete\r\nthis phase for their dataset curation on an individual basis. Each\r\nmember must play an active role in this collaborative effort for this\r\nphase of the process to be completed.\r\n\r\n### Best Practices\r\n\r\nTo account for multi-user collaborations on the server, and for ongoing\r\nrepository maintenance, the best workflow practice is to guide your team\r\nto:\r\n\r\n1)  **Fetch:** Always connect to the server and fetch server updates to\r\n    your local database before making changes in your local project.\r\n    This practice ensures all team members are working from the most\r\n    current version of the repository datasets. To perform the fetch,\r\n    use the “Diff Tool” to sync all or partial changes from the server\r\n\r\n2)  **Edit:** Make changes in the openLCA desktop application;\r\n    occasionally refresh your connection to reflect changes from team\r\n    members\r\n\r\n3)  **Commit:** Commit your changes to the server before disconnecting\r\n\r\n## **Publication**\r\n\r\nOnce your data have been reviewed and curated in the private FLCAC\r\nworking repository, the dataset(s) are ready for publication. By\r\ndefault, FLCAC repositories are private. Repository Owners must toggle\r\nthem to public for publishing. FLCAC recommends for best practices that\r\nthe curated private repository be cloned and made public such that the\r\nprivate database working copy is available in the background to receive\r\nupdates and maintenance. In this way, the public version is static until\r\nscheduled/announced updates occur and the original private repository\r\ncan be modified on an as needed basis. Once the private working copy\r\nupdate and curation tasks are complete, this copy can be repeatedly\r\ncloned to replace the outdated published version.\r\n\r\n![](./media/image30.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 28. Cloning a repository on the FLCAC server**\r\n\r\n![](./media/image31.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 29. Publishing a repository on the FLCAC server**\r\n\r\nYour newly published repository will appear under its group name on the\r\npublic FLCAC portal as a repository on the right hand side of the portal\r\nlanding page.\r\n\r\n![](./media/image32.png)\r\n\r\n**Figure 30. Repository group names in public view**\r\n\r\nFor best practices, FLCAC recommends that once repositories are made\r\npublic, the agency team members ensure that their respective local\r\nopenLCA desktop application databases fetch changes to reflect the most\r\ncurrent versions. Further, as in the FLCAC server, FLCAC recommends one\r\nworking copy and one ‘clean’ copy of each repository be kept on the\r\ndesktop application. That is, changes should always be fetched from and\r\nupdates always be committed to the private server *working copy* until\r\nit is ready for official publication. In this way, the public server\r\nversion remains static and the desktop clean copy reflects this public\r\nversion.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the best practices workflow is as follows:\r\n\r\n  - **Commit** to Private Server Group: Commit your datasets from\r\n    openLCA to a private group on the Collaboration Server\r\n\r\n  - **Curate** Data on Server: agency team may use the Collaboration\r\n    Server editorial features to communicate edits and finalize the\r\n    private version of the datasets on the platform\r\n\r\n  - **Publish** Data on Server: Once the agency (or agency team) has\r\n    approved the indexing of the datasets in the private version, the\r\n    final version is approved and cloned/migrated to the agency’s public\r\n    repository group\r\n\r\n  - **Maintain** Data on Server: The agency maintains the local openLCA\r\n    desktop version of the datasets for preservation.\r\n\r\nTo account for multi-user collaborations on the server, and for ongoing\r\nrepository maintenance, the best workflow practice is to guide your team\r\nto:\r\n\r\n  - **Fetch Changes from Server**: Connect to the Collaboration Server\r\n    to fetch the latest changes from the private server working\r\n    repository to your desktop application\r\n\r\n  - **Make Updates Locally:** Edit to make changes or add datasets in\r\n    the local desktop version\r\n\r\n  - **Commit Updates to Server:** Commit changes to the private server\r\n    working repository for internal agency review (i.e., using the\r\n    editorial features)\r\n\r\n  - **Publish Updates:** Migrate changes to the public agency repository\r\n    for publication\r\n\r\nThe FLCAC Database is updated with new and revised data on an as needed\r\nbasis for most member agencies. Some groups (e.g., NREL) update on a\r\nquarterly basis. Thus, the publication timeline of your data depends on\r\nyour agency publication schedule, the dataset/repository size and when\r\nyour Onboarding & Formatting phases begin. The timeframe is heavily\r\ndependent on the response times between you and team members working to\r\ncurate the repository data during the iterative communications of the\r\nReview phase as well as how many processes are being submitted.\r\n\r\n## **Preservation**\r\n\r\nAs the FLCAC is primarily an access system, it is left to individual\r\nagency members to preserve the final dataset files according to ISO\r\n14721 standards for long-term digital information preservation. That is,\r\nthe final dataset file versions are stabilized, checked for fixity\r\n(i.e., verifying no digital file corruption), and stored such that the\r\noriginal and published datasets and their supporting metadata are\r\narchived. Only the initial dataset submission and the version final\r\ndataset as published are archived. These datasets will be saved until\r\nthe next update is submitted and published. Data longevity should be\r\nnoted at the time of publication according to each member’s publishing\r\nschedule. Older datasets may not be saved in the FLCAC Collaboration\r\nServer but FLCAC members should retain the older datasets such that they\r\nare available upon request or for comparison and verification. Updates\r\nto previously published datasets shall contain a relevant note in the\r\n‘Intended Application’ field of the unit process Administrative\r\nInformation. If a user needs to access an older dataset, they may\r\ncontact the FLCAC member source for a copy.\r\n\r\nGuidance on Data Compilation in openLCA\r\n\r\nThe navigation scheme in openLCA contains the following elements:\r\n\r\n1.  **Projects**: can be created to compare product system variants\r\n\r\n2.  **Product systems:** can be created to link processes into process\r\n    networks (necessary to calculate inventory results and impact\r\n    assessment)\r\n\r\n3.  **Processes**: production or modification of products and materials;\r\n    services\r\n\r\n4.  **Flows**: intermediate and elementary flows\r\n\r\n5.  **Indicators** and parameters: influence the LCIA and data quality\r\n    definitions\r\n    \r\n    1.  ***Impact assessment methods:*** method suite and individual\r\n        LCIA methods area available via openLCA but must be downloaded\r\n        and imported for each database\r\n    \r\n    2.  ***Social indicators:*** same as LCIA methods; used for social\r\n        LCA\r\n    \r\n    3.  ***Global parameters***: where database parameters are created\r\n        and defined; a default value and uncertainty values may be\r\n        assigned\r\n    \r\n    4.  ***Data quality systems:*** database defaults have the\r\n        ecoinvent® data quality system; other data quality systems are\r\n        available via openLCA but must be downloaded and imported for\r\n        each database\r\n\r\n6.  **Background data**: includes definitions for objects that populate\r\n    pull-down menus used in the processes and LCIA methods\r\n    \r\n    5.  ***Flow properties:*** properties of flows (e.g., length, mass,\r\n        etc.)\r\n    \r\n    6.  ***Unit groups***: groups of units (e.g., units of area include\r\n        m<sup>2</sup>, ft2, sq.yd, etc.)\r\n    \r\n    7.  ***Currencies:*** cost can be assigned to flows and Life Cycle\r\n        Costing (LCC) can be performed\r\n    \r\n    8.  ***Actors:*** people who have provided data or modified models\r\n    \r\n    9.  ***Sources:*** literature referenced; can contain URL references\r\n    \r\n    10. ***Locations:*** provides geographic specificity; particularly,\r\n        important for regionalized LCA\r\n\r\nMetadata Guidance Tables\r\n\r\nThe tables below details the conventions for each field of the elements\r\nin the openLCA software.

The full guidance document can be found at\r\n> <span class=\"underline\"><https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?dirEntryId=347251&Lab=NRMRL>.</span>\r\n\r\n#### <span class=\"smallcaps\">Highlight 1: A flow must consist of a ***Flowable*** + ***Context*** + ***Unit***</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n>\r\n>1. ***Flowable*** - The name of the material, energy, or space (e.g., “Carbon dioxide” or “Water, fresh”) that comes from or goes to the biosphere. This is commonly called “substance” or “flow name” but this term is too limited and the term “flowable” from the Earthster Core Ontology (ECO) is used in the FEDEFL report and in the FEDEFL (McBride & Norris, 2010). \r\n>2. ***Context*** - A set of environmental media/compartments that describe the flow origin or destination (e.g., “Air”). Although the term compartment is sometimes used in LCA, the FEDEFL uses the term context to provide a broader meaning that includes the directionality (e.g. “resource” from biosphere or “emission” to biosphere), environmental media (e.g. “Air”, “Water”, “Ground” and “Biotic”), and additional context information that is further described in Section 3.3 of the FEDEFL report. It is mandatory that a flow have a primary context (directionality + environmental media).\r\n>3. ***Unit*** - Flow units may be associated with conversion factors that can be used to convert between different units within a flow property (e.g., kg to lbs.) or even between flow properties (e.g., kg to m^3). \r\n\r\n\r\n#### <span class=\"smallcaps\">Highlight 2: Elementary flow primary contexts</span>\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Contexts are listed by directionality (Resource/Emission) and environmental media (Air,Ground,Water,Biotic)\r\n> \r\n> **Resources**\r\n>\r\n> Resource, Ground\r\n> \r\n> Resource, Water\r\n> \r\n> Resource, Air\r\n> \r\n> Resources, Biotic\r\n>\r\n>**Emissions**\r\n> \r\n> Emissions, Ground\r\n> \r\n> Emissions, Water\r\n> \r\n> Emissions, Air\r\n\r\n\r\n#### <span class=\"smallcaps\">Highlight 3: Environmental media based on phase (e.g. solid, liquid, gas, biosphere)</span>\r\n\r\n> \r\n> The FEDEFL distinguishes between the environmental media and the vertical strata creating a flow context. \r\n\r\n>For example, a resource flow from a groundwater well would have conventionally had ‘ground’ as the media. However, ground more accurately describes the vertical strata from which the resource is extracted, while the environmental media from which the resource is flowing is water. Therefore, in the FEDEFL the terms air, water and ground refer to the media, while another compartment class is used to describe the vertical strata. This is the first time these two compartment classes are used to clarify the difference between environmental media and vertical strata. It is important to note that for emission, the environmental media reflects the media the flow is going to and that for resources it is the media from which a resource originated. \r\n\r\n>The biotic media is used to describe the living media which some material flows from, such as the flow of wood from trees (e.g. Hardwood, Resource/Biotic).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### <span class=\"smallcaps\">Highlight 4: Classifying elementary flows (Eight class system)</span>\r\n\r\n> \r\n> It is recommended that users utilize the eight-classification system as seen below to classify all elementary flows. Usage of the flow classification system helps improve the structure used to organize flows. Flow classes are a way to group EFs by their flowable type. Classes may have sets of contexts and units that distinguish them from flows in other classes.\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n<td><strong>Flow Class</strong></td>\r\n<td><strong>Input/Output</strong></td>\r\n<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>\r\n<td><strong>Default flow units</strong></td>\r\n<td><strong>Example FLowable(s)</strong></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n<td><strong>Element or Compound</strong></td>\r\n<td>Both</td>\r\n<td>A unique chemical element or compound</td>\r\n<td>kg</td>\r\n<td><em>1,1,2,2-Tetrachloethane</em></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n<td><strong>Groups of Chemicals</strong></td>\r\n<td>Both</td>\r\n<td>A group or mixture of chemicals</td>\r\n<td>kg</td>\r\n<td><em>Volatile organic compounds</em></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n<td><strong>Geological</strong></td>\r\n<td>Both</td>\r\n<td>A mineral or metal in an ore or aggregate material extracted for use or refining</td>\r\n<td>MJ or kg</td>\r\n<td><em>Anthracite</em></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n<td><strong>Biological</strong></td>\r\n<td>Both</td>\r\n<td>Input:Biomass or organic matter\r\n\r\n>\r\nOutput: biological matter (e.g. microorganisms, mites and pollen) </td>\r\n<td>kg</td>\r\n<td>Input\r\n\r\n>\r\n<em>Hardwood</em>\r\n\r\n>\r\nOutput\r\n>\r\n\r\n<em>Bacillus Subtilis</em></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n<td><strong>Land Use</strong></td>\r\n<td>Input</td>\r\n<td>Land types</td>\r\n<td>area*time</td>\r\n<td><em>Forest</em></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n<td><strong>Water</strong></td>\r\n<td>Both</td>\r\n<td>Water</td>\r\n<td>kg</td>\r\n<td><em>Water, fresh</em></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"even\">\r\n<td><strong>Energy</strong></td>\r\n<td>Both</td>\r\n<td>Energy input NOT associated with consumed materials\r\n\r\n>\r\nEnergy output in the form of heat</td>\r\n<td>MJ</td>\r\n<td>Input\r\n\r\n>\r\n<em>Energy, Geothermal</em>\r\n\r\n>\r\nOutput\r\n>\r\n<em> Energy, heat</em></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"odd\">\r\n<td><strong>Other</strong></td>\r\n<td>Both</td>\r\n<td>None of the above.

can be used with different units, e.g. radioactive chemicals can use the ‘kg’ or ‘kBq’ units. In instances where multiple units are possible, one unit is set as the FEDEFL default unit and other units are considered alternative units. All flows with an alternative unit exist within the AltUnit files on github by flow class (pictured below)\r\n![](./media/image45.png)\r\n>Alternate units exist using a conversion factor between the different unit types. For each alternate unit there is a single default conversion factor. When mapping flows from an existing source to the FEDEFL users may input their own conversion factors.\r\n \r\n<strong>Example</strong>\r\n>When converting flow names from an existing source, if the source contains conversion factors in the name (e.g. “Hard coal; 32.7 MJ/kg” and the units do not match the default units in the FEDEFL then users should use 32.7 MJ/kg as a conversion factor in the mapping file. However, there is no need to input a conversion factor in the mapping file when the units match the default units in FEDEFL.\r\n\r\n#### <span class=\"smallcaps\">Highlight 7: Geological ‘fuel’ flows, how to use alternative units and account for energy losses</span>\r\n\r\n> \r\n> In general, when creating flows to represent the extraction of raw resources that the name of the raw material being extracted be used. For raw material that are used to produce energy (e.g. fuels), it is important to note that in the FEDEFL there exists default conversion factors (higher heating values (HHV)) to convert the ‘kg’ of raw resource into an energy content. The FEDEFL conversion factors should represent the HHV for the raw material, as this is the correct conversion factor.  Users <strong>should</strong> apply a 5-10% increase in their Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) during refining to address the energy loss from the raw material to the refined material for all non-renewable fuels. \r\n> \r\n\r\n#### <span class=\"smallcaps\">Highlight 8: Minerals, Metals and ores</span>\r\n\r\n> \r\n> When modeling geological flows, the raw resource, or mineral names should be used as the elementary flow flowable. The reason for this recommendation is that this method requires users to track flows through the technosphere transformations to create the metals that are used during manufacturing. When mining metals, gangue or excess rock and non-valuable products as well as trace elements/metals are part of the initial raw resource extraction process. By modeling the raw material mineral, users can account for these by-products in the refining process. \r\nHowever, in some instances this is not possible as users may not know this information. Therefore, metals as raw resources are still included in the ‘Geological’ flow class. Users should be careful when using these flows that they account for the raw material losses from extraction through refining. It is recommended that users apply 5-10% loss of material during refining when calculating the value of the raw material.\r\n\r\n> \r\n#### <span class=\"smallcaps\">Highlight 9: Land Use</span>\r\n\r\n> \r\n>Land transformations should NOT be modeled as flows. Transformations are an activity and should be modeled as a process with land inputs. Only land occupations are flows elementary flows and are named based on the land types. All land occupation should have units of area*time. Any land flows that do not have such units are not in compliance with FEDEFL nomenclature.  \r\n#### \r\n\r\n#### <span class=\"smallcaps\">Highlight 10: Identifying and Formatting ‘Element or Compound’s and ‘Groups of Chemicals’</span>\r\n\r\n> \r\n> All ‘Element or Compound’s and ‘Groups of Chemicals’ are identified using the US EPA Substance Registry Services (SRS) and US EPA Chemistry Dashboard databases. No ‘Element or Compound’ or ‘Groups of Chemicals’ flowables may be added to the FEDEFL without some type of identification found in either of the two databases. At this time formatting of the ‘Element or Compound’ and ‘Groups of Chemicals’ flowables reflects the formatting found in SRS and Chemistry dashboard. \r\n\r\n<strong>Ions</strong>\r\n>Ions should be named using the following nomenclature using the numerical numbers to identify the ion.

Rainwater should only be describing the flow of water from the atmosphere into a rainwater collection systems. Rainwater flowing from a collection system is a technosphere flow as it is NOT flowing directly from the biosphere.\r\n>\r\n>>>**When the original source flow does not provide enough detail; the genaric term, in this case 'Water' can be used when naming the flow even though this is not a preferred FEDEFL term.\r\n\r\n<strong>Water qualtiy parameters</strong>\r\n>Water quality parameters like Chemical/Biological Oxygen Demand are classified under the ‘Other’ elementary flow class. Additional quality parameters like pH are measured using the flowable ‘Hydrogen ion’ found in the ‘Element or Compound’ flow class. \r\n#### <span class=\"smallcaps\">Highlight 12: Location specific data</span>\r\n\r\n>\r\n>There is no need to include locations in the naming of flowables since this information can be captured as part of the exchange metadata. An exchange is defined as a flowable used in a process with specific situational metadata included to describe the flowable.\r\n<strong>Example:</strong>\r\n>When a ‘Particulate Matter, <2.5µm’ flowable is used in process to describe the total particulate matter in ‘kg’ emissions to air from coal power plant in Kentucky, USA from January 1, 2019 – December 31, 2019. The flowable takes on the additional context information of an emission to air and units ‘kg’ to become a unique flow. The additional metadata of being from a specific process (e.g. coal power plant) at a specific location (e.g. Kentucky, USA) from a specific time period (e.g. 2019) to become an exchange. The additional location, time period and process are not part of the FEDEFL nomenclature, but additional metadata to describe the use of this flowable.\r\n\r\n#### <span class=\"smallcaps\">Highlight 13: “Biogenic and fossil gases (e.g. methane and carbon dioxide) ” field</span>\r\n\r\n> \r\n>The FEDEFL nomenclature is founded on the principle that flowables are unique substances. Therefore, when dealing with biogenic or fossil gases the flowables it is recommended not to include these terms. Biogenic carbon dioxide is chemically identical to carbon dioxide and therefore <strong>NOT</strong> a unique substance. \r\n\r\n>Currently, naming gases as biogenic is used as a modelling and accounting workaround for LCA. Since the FEDEFL recommends that users do not distinguish biogenic gases, the FEDEFL recommends the following method for ensuring that biogenic gases are accounted for correctly.   A basic rule is to have the gas (e.g. Carbon dioxide) with the context resource/air.  Flows used to account for any uptake be included in a process in the supply chain, to then add a -1 CF to the GHG LCIA method for this flow to account for this uptake which will canceling out the “biogenic CO2” emission. \r\n#### \r\n\r\n#### <span class=\"smallcaps\">Highlight 14: End-of-life waste </span>\r\n\r\n>While end-of-life waste flows are techniquely flows back to the biosphere, they are classified differently than elementary flows and not included in the FEDEFL. Whenever possible, it is recommended that waste be characterized by the 'Element or Compound' or 'Groups of Chemicals' so that flows can be characterized in LCIA methods. When specifics are not possible, it is recommended that users use the ILCD format for waste flows in naming End of life waste. In OpenLCA, waste flows are maintained in a separate folder.\r\n\r\n#####\r\n># ILCD Nomenclature Rules\r\n\r\n<strong>It is recommended by the FLCAC to use the ILCD nomenclature rules when creating technosphere and process flow names.</strong>\r\n\r\n>\r\n> All rules paraphrased from the ***International Reference Life Cycle\r\n> Data (ILCD) System Handbook on Nomenclature and other Conventions***,\r\n> First edition 2010.

Here you will find all the ‘Processes’ and ‘Flows’ from\r\n> the uploaded FLCAC Database. However, before using an element to\r\n> compile your datasets, it must either exist in the FLCAC Database or\r\n> have been defined in your database. If a field has a pull-down menu\r\n> with options but your desired content is not available, you may add\r\n> items to the associated field list using the openLCA navigation panel.\r\n> For example, you may need to add yourself as an actor. Shown below is\r\n> the sequence for adding this element. Once added as an actor, you will\r\n> appear as a choice in the pull-down menu for selecting Actors, e.g.,\r\n> in populating the Administrative Information fields. Other additions\r\n> (e.g., processes, flows, providers, sources, etc.) follow a similar\r\n> procedure. NREL requests that processes be filed in existing\r\n> categories. Please contact the Data Curator if you feel none of the\r\n> available categories are appropriate and NREL will work with you to\r\n> add a category.\r\n\r\n![](./media/image33.png)\r\n\r\n**STEP 1. openLCA Element Addition: Right-click on the element in the\r\nnavigation tree**\r\n\r\n![](./media/image34.png)\r\n\r\n**STEP 2. openLCA Element Addition: Select “New \\[element\\]”**\r\n\r\n![](./media/image35.png)\r\n\r\n**STEP 3 openLCA Element Addition: Enter content as applicable**\r\n\r\n![](./media/image36.png)\r\n\r\n**STEP 4. openLCA Element Addition: Complete additional fields once the\r\nUUID is created**\r\n\r\n![](./media/image37.png)\r\n\r\n**STEP 5. openLCA Element Addition: The newly created element now\r\navailable in the navigation tree**\r\n\r\n# Using the EPA Data Quality Pedigree Matrix in openLCA\r\n\r\n## **Step 1: DOWNLOAD THE MATRIX**\r\n\r\nYou may download the US EPA Data Quality Matrix from the openLCA\r\nDownloads page\r\n([<span class=\"underline\">https://www.openlca.org/download/</span>](https://www.openlca.org/download/)).\r\n\r\n![](./media/image38.png)\r\n\r\n**STEP 1: Downloading the US EPA Data Quality Pedigree Matrix Zip Files\r\nfrom openLCA Downloads**\r\n\r\n## **Step 2: IMPORT THE MATRIX**\r\n\r\nTo add the US EPA Data Quality to your openLCA “Indicators &\r\nParameters,” you must import it for each database in which you wish to\r\nuse this Pedigree Matrix (as the only default matrix available is that\r\nfrom ecoinvent®).\r\n\r\n  - Thus, you can open the database of interest in openLCA, right-click\r\n    on the database name, and select “Import.”\r\n\r\n  - You may then select “Linked Data (JSON-LD)” and “Next.”\r\n\r\n  - In the “Choose Directory” field, designate your “Downloads” folder\r\n    and the “USEPA\\_DataQualitySchemes\\_JSON-LDforopenLCA1.6.zip” you\r\n    just downloaded should appear as an option.\r\n\r\n![](./media/image39.png)\r\n\r\n**STEP 2: Importing the US EPA Data Quality Pedigree Matrix Zip File\r\ninto openLCA**\r\n\r\n**<span class=\"smallcaps\">Step 3: DESIGNATE THE MATRIX INSIDE EACH\r\nPROCESS</span>**\r\n\r\n  - Select “USEPA\\_DataQualitySchemes\\_JSON-LDforopenLCA1.6.zip” and\r\n    click “Finish.” The Pedigree Matrix file is not very large so should\r\n    import very quickly.\r\n\r\n  - Next, open your process of interest and on the first “General\r\n    Information” tab, you may scroll down to the “Data quality” section\r\n    and “Process schema” field. There is a drop-down menu and the “US\r\n    EPA – Process Pedigree Matrix” should now be an option you may\r\n    select.\r\n\r\n  - You will also want to go to the “Flow schema” field just below and\r\n    select “US EPA – Flow Pedigree Matrix” from its drop-down menu such\r\n    that you can elect data quality indicators at both the process and\r\n    flow levels.\r\n\r\n![](./media/image40.png)\r\n\r\n**STEP 3a: Designating the US EPA Process Pedigree Matrix**\r\n\r\n![](./media/image41.png)\r\n\r\n**STEP 3b:Designating the US EPA Flow Pedigree Matrix**\r\n\r\n**<span class=\"smallcaps\">Step 4: SELECT PROCESS INDICATORS</span>**\r\n\r\nNow, you may select the “Data quality entry” “not specified” hyperlink\r\n(still on the first “General information” tab, “Data quality” section).\r\nYou should now be able click on matrix cells to select entries for\r\n“Process Review” and “Process Completeness” data quality indicators.\r\n\r\n![](./media/image42.png)\r\n\r\n**STEP 4a: Designating the Data Quality Entry at Process Level **\r\n\r\n![](./media/image43.png)\r\n\r\n**STEP 4b: Selecting Process Indicator Matrix Cell Entries**\r\n\r\n**<span class=\"smallcaps\">Step 5: SELECT FLOW INDICATORS</span>**\r\n\r\nYou may now go to the “Data quality entry” column of any input or output\r\nflow on the “inputs/Outputs” tab to select entries for the following\r\ndata quality categories:\r\n\r\n  - Flow reliability\r\n\r\n  - Temporal correlation\r\n\r\n  - Geographical correlation\r\n\r\n  - Technological correlation\r\n\r\n  - Data collection methods\r\n\r\n![](./media/image44.png)\r\n\r\n**STEP 5: Selecting Flow Indicators**\r\n\r\nFor guidance on selecting process- and flow-level indicators for your\r\nlife cycle inventory (LCI) data, please see the: **U.S. Environmental\r\nProtection Agency (EPA) Guidance on Data Quality Assessment for Life\r\nCycle Inventory Data**\r\n([<span class=\"underline\">https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si\\_public\\_record\\_report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL\\&dirEntryId=321834</span>](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=321834)).\r\n\r\nIf you need to cite the EPA Data Quality Guidance document:\r\n\r\nEdelen, A.

This requirement exists to enable data transfer and does not imply\r\n    an official endorsement of openLCA as a life cycle modeling tool.\r\n\r\n2.  For more information regarding motivations for data aggregation,\r\n    see: Table 3.1 Motivations for aggregated datasets, UNEP/SETAC 2011\r\n    Global Guidance Principles for Life Cycle Assessment Databases: A\r\n    Basis for Greener Processes and Products, a.k.a., The “Shonan\r\n    Guidance Principles,’ available at:\r\n    [<span class=\"underline\">https://www.lifecycleinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2011%20-%20Global%20Guidance%20Principles.pdf</span>](https://www.lifecycleinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/2011%20-%20Global%20Guidance%20Principles.pdf).\r\n\r\n3.  JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data (JSON-LD) files are a\r\n    method of encoding linked data designed around the concept of\r\n    “context” for ontologies and recommended by the World Wide Web\r\n    Consortium (W3C). This notation format is lightweight,\r\n    human-readable, can be directly parsed and so linked to ontologies.\r\n\r\n4.  This requirement exists to enable data transfer and does not imply\r\n    an official endorsement of openLCA as a life cycle modeling tool.\r\n\r\n5.  Note, when creating a new process in openLCA, it is possible to\r\n    create a waste treatment process selecting a waste flow previously\r\n    created as quantitative reference (the reference input of this\r\n    process).\r\n\r\n6.  Data exported from SimaPRO and ecoinvent® in the ecospold file\r\n    format do not have a UUID. Therefore, if a SimaPRO-generated\r\n    ecospold file is imported into a users’ openLCA, the software will\r\n    assign a new UUID and can cause breaks in the linking between\r\n    existing flows and processes in the FLCAC repository.\r\n\r\n7.
