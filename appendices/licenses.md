# Appendix C - Creative Commons Legal Code

**<span class="smallcaps">CC0 1.0 Universal</span>**

Official translations of this legal tool are available

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION
ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE
USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER AND
DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT
OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.

**<span class="smallcaps">Statement of Purpose</span>**

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work
of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in
other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the
ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural
and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for
their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or
she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under
its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in
the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those
rights.

1.  **Copyright and Related Rights.** A Work made available under CC0
    may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights
    ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights
    include, but are not limited to, the following:

<!-- end list -->

1.  the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
    communicate, and translate a Work;

2.  moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

3.  publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
    likeness depicted in a Work;

4.  rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
    subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

5.  rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of
    data in a Work;

6.  database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of
    the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the
    legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation
    thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
    directive); and

7.  other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
    world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
    implementations thereof.

**Waiver.** To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in
contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully,
permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and
surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated
claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including
existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i)
in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by
applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in
any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for
any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the
Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such
Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

2.  **Public License Fallback.** Should any part of the Waiver for any
    reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable
    law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent
    permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of
    Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer
    hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
    non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable and
    unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related
    Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
    maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including
    future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and
    for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
    including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
    purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
    of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part
    of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
    ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
    ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
    and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
    exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in
    the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action
    with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
    express Statement of Purpose.

3.  **Limitations and Disclaimers.**

<!-- end list -->

1.  No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,
    abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this
    document.

2.  Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
    non-infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects,
    accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
    discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under
    applicable law.

3.  Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other
    persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including
    without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the
    Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any
    necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use
    of the Work.

4.  Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
    this CC0 or use of the Work.
