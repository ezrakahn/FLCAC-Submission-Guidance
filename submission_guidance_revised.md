#### Basics
A DOI, or Digital Object Identifier, is a persistent and unique identifier assigned to an object. This DOI permanently identifies content and related metadata for an object over the course of its lifecycle. DOI strings, in combination with a URL prefix, resolve to internet locations. Information about a digital object may change over time, including where to find it and who owns it, but its DOI will not change. The benefits of a DOI include greater discoverability and access to uniquely identified content, accessibility for long-term use, and citation of publications and research data for impact analysis.
DOIs require a commitment from the provider to maintain the URL associated with the DOI.
